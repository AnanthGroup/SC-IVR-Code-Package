# SC-Corr-Code-Package
The SC-Corr Code Package is a FORTRAN-based program that contains various ways of computing the real-time correlation function in the semiclassical initial value representation.

The extension of MQC-IVR to nonadiabatic model systems is now available in the file 'NA_MQCIVR.zip'. This is soon to be included in the SC-CORR Code Package.

Created by Matthew S. Church.
